                    <h2>Addressing the Issue of Marine Plastic Debris</h2>
                    <p>
                        As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have real-time data. However, I can provide some general
                        information on the topic based on trends up to that point. For the most recent and accurate data, I recommend checking
                        the latest reports and publications from relevant organizations.
                        
                        As of 2013, it was estimated that there were 86 million tons of plastic marine debris in the world's oceans, with an
                        annual input of 8.8 million metric tons. China was identified as a significant contributor to mismanaged plastic waste.
                        
                        Efforts have been made globally to address plastic pollution, including initiatives to reduce plastic usage, improve
                        waste management, and promote recycling. Various countries and organizations have set targets to curb plastic pollution
                        and enhance marine conservation.
                        
                        To get the latest figures on plastic marine debris and related statistics, I recommend checking reports from
                        organizations such as the United Nations, the Ocean Cleanup, or other environmental agencies. These entities regularly
                        provide updates on the state of marine pollution and global efforts to mitigate its impact.

                    <p>
                        In 2011, at the age of 16, Dutch innovator Boyan Slat encountered an alarming abundance of plastic debris compared to
                        marine life during a diving expedition in Greece. This eye-opening experience spurred him to channel his efforts into a
                        high school project aimed at delving deeper into the issue of ocean plastic pollution and understanding the prevailing
                        belief that cleaning it up was deemed impossible.
                        
                        Since then, Boyan Slat has evolved into a prominent environmental entrepreneur and the founder of The Ocean Cleanup, a
                        nonprofit organization dedicated to developing advanced technologies to remove plastic waste from the world's oceans.
                        The project has garnered global attention and support, showcasing Slat's commitment to addressing one of the most
                        pressing environmental challenges of our time. His innovative solutions and ambitious initiatives continue to contribute
                        to the ongoing fight against ocean plastic pollution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Boyan Slat made the decision to discontinue his aerospace engineering studies at TU Delft to fully commit his time to
                        developing his groundbreaking idea. In 2013, he went on to establish The Ocean Cleanup with the overarching goal of
                        creating advanced technologies to effectively eliminate plastic pollution from the world's oceans. The organization's
                        mission revolves around the development and implementation of innovative solutions to address this pressing
                        environmental issue.
                        
                        In a significant milestone for The Ocean Cleanup, a comprehensive 528-page feasibility study detailing the potential of
                        the project was published in June 2014. This study likely delved into the technical aspects, environmental impact, and
                        logistical considerations of the proposed initiatives. The publication of such a study underscores the organization's
                        commitment to transparency and the dissemination of valuable information related to their ambitious undertaking.

                            The filtering system uses passive floating structures localized in the ocean gyres.
                            These structures act as a containment boom.
                            The floater drifts with the wind, waves and ocean currents to capture marine debris.
                            A permeable screen underneath the float catches subsurface debris.

                            the
                            organization employed <em>System 001/B</em> which could successfully capture and collect
                            plastic, and
                            even
                            microplastics.

                            At the end of July 2021, the organization revisited the Great Pacific Garbage Patch
                            to trial <em>System 002</em>-- a revamped version of the previous systems with an increased
                            span
                            of
                            1,600
                            metres.
                            The new technology claims to capture 1,000 kg of plastics per day. As of 25 July 2022, The
                            Ocean
                            Cleanup
                            announced to have removed a total of 100,000 kg of plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage
                            Patch.

                        <p>
                            The organization is now developing <em>System 003</em>,
                            which is planned to have a three times bigger plastic intake than the current design.
                            Unlike the previous prototypes,
                            this new system is meant to be a blueprint for an entire fleet of filtering systems
                            able to meet the scale of the problem.

                            Addressing concerns about the maintenance and cost-effectiveness of filtering devices closer to shore, the organization
                            has continuously evolved its approach. In a significant update in October 2019, the organization introduced the River
                            Interceptor, a cutting-edge technology designed to enhance plastic waste recovery in water bodies.
                            
                            Powered by solar energy, the Interceptor vessels employ innovative floating arms to efficiently guide floating waste
                            towards a collection conveyor. This conveyor seamlessly deposits the gathered trash into dumpsters situated on a
                            detachable barge positioned below the Interceptor. The use of this advanced technology aims to optimize the collection
                            process, ensuring a more effective and economical means of plastic recovery.

                            As of October 2022, The Ocean Cleanup enterntains eight Interceptors in Indonesia,
                            Malaysia, Viet Nam, Dominican Republic, USA and Jamaica.
